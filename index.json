Central to this endeavor is the imperative to restore natural longitudinal and lateral connectivity of rivers and floodplains. Focused on scrutinizing data, methods, and tools employed in published studies from 2000 to 2023, our literature review reveals both encouraging developments and significant challenges at pan-European and regional scales to prioritize barriers for removal. Positive advancements include notable efforts in (i) data collection for a diverse range of taxa, and (ii) barrier data acquisition over the past two decades. Additionally, (iii) robust prioritization algorithms have been established. However, there remain significant challenges in applying these frameworks consistently across diverse geographical regions. We identified knowledge gaps in the (iv) quality of the available data, emphasizing the need for more accurate information on barrier characteristics, (v) the lack of inclusion of social aspects, and (vi) the need for expanding the focus beyond commercially significant species. We conclude that the absence of unified efforts, along with disparities in data and the lack of clear objectives for the restoration of free-flowing rivers, pose a significant constraint. It is essential to further acknowledge the necessity to address the opportunity costs, culturally important freshwater species, and climate change impacts. Collaborative solutions based on clear objectives are required to apply the ambitious goals of restoring free-flowing rivers in the context of the Nature Restoration Law.","tags":[],"title":"Evaluating the readiness for river barrier removal: A scoping review under the EU nature restoration law","type":"publication"},{"authors":["MSc. Kristi Bego","Dr. Sami Domisch"],"categories":null,"content":"Mapping the complementary amphibian biodiversity facets across the Western Balkans\nYou can be part of this project!\nWe are looking for species occurrence data for the following countries: Greece, Macedonia, Montenegro, Bosnia \u0026amp; Herzegovina, Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, Slovenia and Hungary\nIf you wish to help by providing data, please contact: kristi.bego@igb-berlin.de\nFreshwater ecosystems cover less than one percent of the Earth’s surface but house over 12% of all recorded species, and over 33% of vertebrates. The services provided by these ecosystems are invaluable, and yet there is an ongoing freshwater crisis that has been slowly building up over the years as water demand continues to grow. As a result there has been a continuous decline in freshwater vertebrate populations since the 1970s, a trend which is still on a downward slope. Among vertebrates, amphibians stand out globally as the most threatened vertebrate group according to IUCN (2020), however they don’t receive the same conservation attention and often get overlooked, as is the case with amphibians still not being included in the EU Water Framework Directive.\nThe Western Balkans is often regarded as a biodiversity hotspot, with amphibians representing a key biodiversity group for this region. It is home to 29 amphibian species, including endemic and protected species, with countries like Croatia hosting 25% of all european amphibian species. The typical threats to populations in the Balkans are habitat destruction, alteration and fragmentation, pollution, UV-B radiation, disease, introduced species, exploitation, climate change and more. This emphasizes the conservation interest in amphibians of the Balkan region as a whole.\nIn this project we will be studying the spatial species and functional diversity patterns of amphibians in the Western Balkan biodiversity hotspot. We will evaluate the spatial similarity and uniqueness of these diversity patterns by investigating both local connectivity and upstream/downstream connectivity at the same time. We also aim to identify possible priority conservation areas, by highlighting areas where these biodiversity facets can be spatially prioritized. Essentially, we wish to know how congruent amphibian species and functional diversity patterns are between them, and how contigent are spatial prioritization areas on species \u0026amp; functional diversity patterns.\nTo this end, we will map the species distributions of all amphibian species found in the Western Balkan region, utilizing species distribution models based on existing occurrence records. These network-based distribution models will account for connectivity among other key environmental factors to map suitable habitats for amphibians in the Western Balkans. We expect patterns of species distribution and range size to emerge across the hydrographic network of the region. Building upon the distribution models, we will investigate and map the functional trait diversity and uniqueness of amphibians in the region, to uncover possible patterns of functional drainage endemism. Finally, we will combine both of these approaches through a spatial prioritization framework to analyze hotspots of conservation importance in the Western Balkan region.\nUltimately through this project we expect to shed more light and broaden our understanding of the intricate environmental interactions and dynamics of amphibian populations of the Western Balkans biodiversity hotspot. We hope that the findings presented by our project will open the door to more discussions on bettering global conservation efforts, highlighting the importance and conservation interest of amphibians as a vertebrate group, as well as providing a baseline for spatial prioritization with the purpose of increasing the efficiency of said conservation efforts.\nAs we prepare data and vizualizations, they will be added to this page throughout the development of the project.\n","date":1727740800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1727740800,"objectID":"d6f09caf4dff7d6d043fda2f39ebc737","permalink":"https://glowabio.org/project/western_balkans_amphibians/","publishdate":"2024-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/western_balkans_amphibians/","section":"project","summary":"Mapping the complementary amphibian biodiversity facets across the Western Balkans","tags":["Freshwater biodiversity","Conservation planning","Open-source GIS"],"title":"Western Balkans amphibian biodiversity facets","type":"project"},{"authors":["T.

It remains a challenge to relate their contributions and complex spatio-temporal cause-effect chains to a given time and location. To disentangle these relationships, we combined 12 environmental variables with changes in more than 25,000 discharge time series globally and identified the variable importance across climate zones using random forest analyses. The results show that (a) about two-thirds of the global catchments experienced significant changes in discharge between 1980s and 1990s and (b) more than 80% of the basins with new dams built during the study period have experienced changes, twice as many as basins without dams. Furthermore, (c) most environmental variables were subject to significant changes, especially precipitation, temperature and urban land cover; (d) strong changes in the discharge regime were mostly associated with precipitation, followed by land cover changes, and (e) impacts of water infrastructure are dominant in basins with weak evidence of change in discharge.

However, the research on freshwaters lags behind terrestrial and marine studies, highlighting the need for innovative approaches to comprehend freshwater biodiversity. __Objectives__ We investigated patterns in the relationships between biotic uniqueness and abiotic environmental uniqueness in drainage basins worldwide. __Methods__We compiled high-quality data on aquatic insects (mayflies, stoneflies, and caddisflies at genus-level) from 42 drainage basins spanning four continents. Within each basin we calculated biotic uniqueness (local contribution to beta diversity, LCBD) of aquatic insect assemblages, and four types of abiotic uniqueness (local contribution to environmental heterogeneity, LCEH), categorized into upstream land cover, chemical soil properties, stream site landscape position, and climate. A mixed-effects meta-regression was performed across basins to examine variations in the strength of the LCBD-LCEH relationship in terms of latitude, human footprint, and major continental regions (the Americas versus Eurasia). __Results__On average, relationships between LCBD and LCEH were weak. However, the strength and direction of the relationship varied among the drainage basins. Latitude, human footprint index, or continental location did not explain significant variation in the strength of the LCBD-LCEH relationship. __Conclusions__We detected strong context dependence in the LCBD-LCEH relationship across the drainage basins. Varying environmental conditions and gradient lengths across drainage basins, land-use change, historical contingencies, and stochastic factors may explain these findings. This context dependence underscores the need for basin-specific management practices to protect the biodiversity of riverine systems.","tags":[],"title":"The relationships between biotic uniqueness and abiotic uniqueness are context dependent across drainage basins worldwide","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Historical anthropogenic alterations have, and future climate change will further affect rivers and the species therein. While many studies have projected climate change effects on species, little is known about the severity of these changes compared to historical alterations. Here, we used a unique 300-year time series of hydrological and climate data to explore the vulnerability of 48 native fish species in the upper Danube River Basin to past and potential future environmental changes. __Location__ - Upper Danube River Basins (Germany and Austria). __Methods__ - We applied a climate niche factor analysis and calculated species-specific vulnerability estimates based on modelled and observed hydrological and climate data from 1800 to 2100. We compared the estimated species vulnerabilities between two historical time intervals (1800–1830 and 1900–1930) and a future time interval (2070–2100, including the two representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5) to an observed reference time interval (1970–2000). In addition, we identified the main environmental drivers of species vulnerability and their change over the past 200 years and for the predicted 100 years in the future. __Results__ - Our results showed that (i) in the past, species vulnerability was mainly driven by changes in discharge, while (ii) future potential vulnerabilities would be due to temperature. Moreover, we found that (iii) future environmental conditions for riverine fish species driven by temperature would change at a similar magnitude as past hydrological changes, driven by anthropogenic river alterations. Future changes, projected for the RCP 4.5, would result in moderate species vulnerability, whereas for the RCP 8.5, the vulnerability for all species would substantially increase compared to the historical conditions. __Main Conclusion__ - Accounting for an extended timeline uncovers the extent of historical pressures and provides unprecedented opportunities to proactively plan conservation strategies that are necessary to address future challenges.","tags":[],"title":"300 years of past and future changes for native fish species in the upper Danube River Basin– historical flow alterations versus future climate change","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

For targeted conservation efforts, mapping and understanding the distribution of freshwater organisms consists of an important knowledge gap. Spatial modelling approaches offer valuable insights into present-day biodiversity patterns and potential future trajectories, however methodological constraints still hamper the applicability of addressing future climate and land cover change concurrently in one modelling workflow. Compared to climate-only projections, spatially explicit and high-resolution land cover projections have seen less attention, and the lack of such data challenges modelling efforts to predict the possible future effects of land cover change especially on freshwater organisms. Here we demonstrate a workflow where we downscale future land cover projection data from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios for South America at 1 km2 spatial resolution, to then predict the future habitat suitability patterns of the Colombian fish fauna. Specifically, we show how the land cover data can be converted from plain numbers into a spatially explicit representation for multiple SSP scenarios and at high spatial resolution, employing freshwater-specific downscaling aspects when spatially allocating the land cover category grid cells, and how it can be fitted into an ensemble species distribution modelling approach of 1209 fish species. Our toolbox consists of a suite of open-source tools, including Dinamica EGO, R, GRASS GIS and GDAL, and we provide the code and necessary steps to reproduce the workflow for other study areas.

One major obstacle lies in the complex geospatial processing of large amounts of data, such as stream network, sub-catchment and basin data, that are necessary for addressing the longitudinal connectivity among water bodies. Workflows thus need to be scalable, especially when working across large spatial extents and at high spatial resolution. This in turn requires advanced command-line GIS skills and programming language integration, which often poses a challenge for freshwater researchers.    __2.__ To address this challenge, we developed the package \\texttt{hydrographr} that provides scalable hydrographic data processing in R. The package contains functions for downloading data of the high-resolution Hydrography90m dataset, processing, reading and extracting information, as well as assessing network distances and connectivity. While the functions are, by default, tailored towards the Hydrography90m data, they can also be generalized towards other data and purposes, such as efficient cropping and merging of raster and vector data, point-raster extraction, raster reclassification, and data aggregation. The package depends on the open-source software GDAL/OGR, GRASS-GIS and the AWK programming language in the Linux environment, allowing a seamless language integration. Since the data is processed outside R, _hydrographr_ allows creating scalable geo-processing workflows.   __3.__ We illustrate the \\texttt{hydrographr} functions using two workflows that focus on (i) a freshwater species distribution modelling approach, and (ii) assessing stream connectivity given the fragmentation by dams. We also provide a detailed guide for the initial installation of the required software. Windows users need to first enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) feature, and can then follow the same software installation as Linux users. \\texttt{hydrographr} is maintained on GitHub at [https://github.com/glowabio/hydrographr](https://github.com/glowabio/hydrographr).  __4.__ _hydrographr_ provides a set of key functions for processing freshwater geospatial data. We expect that the package will support the freshwater-related research communities given the easy-to-use wrapper functions that allow capitalizing on powerful open-source command-line software, which may otherwise require a steep learning curve. Users can thus perform large-scale freshwater-specific longitudinal connectivity and network analyses across large geographic extents while staying within the R environment.","tags":[],"title":"hydrographr: an R package for scalable hydrographic data processing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.

Mitigation measures, including wastewater treatment and hydromorphological restoration, have aimed to improve environmental quality and foster the recovery of freshwater biodiversity2. Here, using 1,816 time series of freshwater invertebrate communities collected across 22 European countries between 1968 and 2020, we quantified temporal trends in taxonomic and functional diversity and their responses to environmental pressures and gradients. We observed overall increases in taxon richness (0.73% per year), functional richness (2.4% per year) and abundance (1.17% per year). However, these increases primarily occurred before the 2010s, and have since plateaued. Freshwater communities downstream of dams, urban areas and cropland were less likely to experience recovery. Communities at sites with faster rates of warming had fewer gains in taxon richness, functional richness and abundance. Although biodiversity gains in the 1990s and 2000s probably reflect the effectiveness of water-quality improvements and restoration projects, the decelerating trajectory in the 2010s suggests that the current measures offer diminishing returns. Given new and persistent pressures on freshwater ecosystems, including emerging pollutants, climate change and the spread of invasive species, we call for additional mitigation to revive the recovery of freshwater biodiversity.","tags":[],"title":"The recovery of European freshwater biodiversity has come to a halt","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marlene Schürz","Dr. Jaime R.

Therefore, a hydrographic network that accurately delineatesboth small streams and large rivers with equal precision, along with their topographic and topological properties, would be indispensable in the earth sciences. However, no such hydrographic study has been publishedto date. Perhaps equally critical is the absence of small headwater streams in global hydrographies, as theseare estimated to contribute to more than 70 % of overall stream length. We aimed to fill this gap by using theMERIT Hydro Digital Elevation Model at 3 arc-sec (ca. 90 m at the equator) to derive a globally seamless, standardised hydrographic network, the 'Hydrography90m', with corresponding stream topographic and topologicalinformation. A central feature of the network is the minimal upstream contributing area, i.e. flow accumulation,of 0.05 km2 (or 5 ha) to initiate a stream channel, which allowed us to extract headwater stream channels ingreat detail. By employing a suite of GRASS GIS hydrological modules, we calculated the range-wide upstreamflow accumulation and flow direction to delineate a total of 1.6 million drainage basins, and extracted globallya total of 726 million unique stream segments with their corresponding sub-catchments. In addition, we computed stream topographic variables comprising stream slope, gradient, length, and curvature attributes, as wellas stream topological variables to allow for network routing and various stream order classifications. We validated the spatial accuracy and flow accumulation of Hydrography90m against NHDPlus HR, an independent,national high-resolution hydrographic network dataset of the United States. Our validation shows that the newlydeveloped Hydrography90m has the highest spatial precision, and contains more headwater stream channelscompared to three other global hydrographic datasets. This inclusive approach provides a vital, and long-overdue baseline for assessing actual streamflow in headwaters, and opens new research avenues for high-resolution studies of surface water worldwide. Hydrography90m thus offers significant potential to facilitate the assessment offreshwater quantity and quality, inundation risk, biodiversity and conservation, as well as resource managementobjectives in a globally comprehensive and standardised manner. We provide all the computed layers for visualisation and download in 20° × 20° tiles at https://public.igb-berlin.de/index.php/s/agciopgzXjWswF4.

Anthropological influences, such as land-cover change, play an important role in these processes. In Latin America, freshwater fish show high rates of diversity and endemism. At the same time, ecosystems in Latin America are threatened by high rates of land-cover change. Therefore, Colombia, endowed with a great habitat diversity and species richness due to a combination of altitude, climate and geographic location, but also distinct land-cover dynamics, was chosen as a case study for this work.\nThe objective of the thesis was (i) to consider the land-cover types prevalent, past trends of land-cover change and future land-cover changes projected according to the shared socioeconomic pathway scenarios (SSPs) (ii) to discern the influence of environmental factors, including land-cover, on suitable habitats of Colombian fish species and (iii) to project the possible future development of fish habitats and species richness. The main tools used for these analysis were land-cover modelling (with Dinamica EGO) and species distribution modelling (with BIOMOD).\nThe analysis of past land-cover changes shows that factors such as demand or policies contribute to both increases and decreases in agricultural land expansion and deforestation and also that trends are not stable. The land-cover projections are driven by population development, nutrition or technological progress assumptions incorporated in the SSP scenarios and thus represent the trends of “Sustainability” (SSP1), “Middle of the road” (SSP2), “Regional rivalry” (SSP3), “Inequality” (SSP4) or “Fossil-fueled development” (SSP5).\nThe projected landcover change for a larger window of Colombia until 2070 following the SSP1 storyline:\nAcross all 1,209 modelled fish species, models suggest that until 2050 and 2070 species richness in the study area will increase and spatial expansion of suitable habitats will occur. Land-cover, unlike climate, had a poor contribution to the projection of changes in habitat development and species richness. As a function of present temperature and precipitation in projected suitable habitats, future habitats of species in presently warmer habitats are projected to have more area, higher elevation on average and lower flow accumulation, than species with lower mean present habitat temperatures. For the Colombian endemic species (n=219) analysed - more likely projected in lower-temperature sub-catchments - the species distribution model projects stagnating future richness, decreasing habitat area, a shift to higher elevated habitats as well as higher extinction rates compared to non-endemic species.\nMigration, expansion or extinction of certain fish species, caused, altered or accelerated by changes in environmental conditions, for example by climate change, are likely to affect the composition, diversity, function, and services of fish communities, further impacting the whole freshwater ecosystem and also structures and systems beyond. Projecting potential future environmental changes and species distributions through models can accordingly help identify factors that may affect species populations or locate places where threats to certain species are particularly high so that appropriate conservation planning steps can be taken.\n","date":1656633600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656633600,"objectID":"6cd9458eced654b6bbfcb6d97e151db3","permalink":"https://glowabio.org/project/ssp_landcover/","publishdate":"2022-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ssp_landcover/","section":"project","summary":"A workflow for downscaling SSP storylines and modelling fish distributions","tags":["Freshwater biodiversity","Geo-informatics","Open-source GIS"],"title":"SSP projections of landcover and fish","type":"project"},{"authors":["Thomas Tomiczek","Dr. Jaime R.

This exceptional fish fauna has, however, rarely been considered when selecting areas for biodiversity conservation. This study integrates freshwater fish distributions into a spatial prioritization exercise to assess to which extent (i) freshwater biodiversity, using fish as a proxy, is currently represented within the existing protected areas, and (ii) if alternative protected area networks may have the potential to increase the number of fish species under protection.\nAt first all available fish data was collated, resulting in a data base of over 112,535 geographic occurrences of 1224 freshwater fishes across Colombia with harmonized nomenclature and revised geo-referenced coordinates.\nBased on a digital elevation model at 1 km2 resolution, the stream network was delineated with a minimum catchment size of 90 km2 and extracted the corresponding 33,612 sub-catchments that served as spatial units within the analyses. In the next step fish occurrence data and environmental variables (climate, topography, land cover, hydrology) were aggregated across the sub-catchments and an ensemble of species distribution modelling algorithms was employed to project suitable habitat of each fish species across the study area.\nFollowing the principles of systematic conservation planning, integer linear programming was applied to delineate a hypothetical protected area network that fulfills minimum, predefined conservation targets for each fish species, i.e. maximizing species representativeness and connectivity among river catchments, while minimizing the cost of anthropogenic impact, represented by the human footprint index and required area for protection. This spatial prioritization was carried out for four different conservation targets, set to protect 20 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 % of each fish species suitable habitats in the priority network.\nThe projected suitable habitats of freshwater fish show high species richness in the Amazon and Orinoco basins while endemic and threatened fish mainly are projected for the Magdalena-Cauca and Pacific-Choco region.\nStacking the individual fish predictions gives an estimate of species richness (low: purple, high:yellow), where red points represent the fish sampling occurences:\nThe calculated total area of the hypothetical priority area network is between 279,077 km2 and 754,400 km2 for the different conservation targets. It represents 12.1 % – 32.6 % of the study area, needed for the conservation of 20 % - 50 % of 1224 Colombian freshwater fish species. Most sub-catchments are prioritized in the Amazon and Orinoco basins and the least in the Caribbean basins. The priority network extents into the neighboring countries of Colombia, signifying the need of transboundary cooperation in freshwater conservation. Between 9.2 % to 28.2 % of Colombia’s protected areas coincide with the projected priority area network. A sensitivity analysis, locking in the existing protected areas in the spatial prioritization solution, reveals a priority area network 16.3 % to 34.7 % larger than that of the minimum cost priority network. It indicates that the existing protected areas inadequately represent freshwater fish in Colombia.\nConservation efforts are best focused on the Magdalena-Cauca and Pacific-Choco basins for the expansion of protected areas, since the majority of endemic and threatened fish species occurs within those basins. This thesis represents a first important step in the integration of freshwater biodiversity for spatial area prioritization and can serve as a baseline scenario for future conservation planning exercises in Colombia.\nPotential protected areas for this region are represented in red, here for a target of 20% of the suitable habitat of each 1224 freshwater fish in Colombia, accounting for the lowest human footprint index and sub-catchment size:\n","date":1654214400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654214400,"objectID":"3c2558ad5ff4ce88cfaf0684e55df335","permalink":"https://glowabio.org/project/colombia_conservation/","publishdate":"2022-06-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/colombia_conservation/","section":"project","summary":"Priority areas for the freshwater fish fauna","tags":["Freshwater biodiversity","Conservation planning","Geo-informatics","Open-source GIS"],"title":"Conservation planning across Colombia","type":"project"},{"authors":["Dr. Giuseppe Amatulli","Dr. Sami Domisch"],"categories":null,"content":"The Geomorphho90m dataset\n» Click here for the visualization «\nTopographical relief comprises the vertical and horizontal variations of the Earth’s terrain and drives processes in geomorphology, biogeography, climatology, hydrology and ecology.

Understanding the invasion process is critical to predicting impacts and informing management. Invasion dynamics have been assumed to follow an 'invasion curve' (S-shaped curve of available area invaded), and similarly, we propose an 'impact curve' describing the impacts generated by invasive alien species over time based on cumulative abundance. To test this curve's large-scale applicability, we used the New Zealand mud snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum, one of the most damaging freshwater invaders. Using long-term (1979-2020) abundance and environmental data across 306 European sites, we observed that P. antipodarum abundance generally increased through time, with slower population growth at higher latitudes and with lower runoff depth. Fifty-nine percent of these populations followed the impact curve, characterized by first occurrence, exponential growth, then long-term saturation. This behaviour is consistent with boom-bust dynamics, as saturation occurs due to a rapid decline in abundance over time. Across sites, we estimated that impact peaked approximately two decades after first detection. The S-shaped impact curve may be common among many invasive species that undergo complex invasion dynamics, urging rapid management actions to mitigate impact.","tags":[],"title":"Invasion impacts and dynamics of a European-wide introduced species","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

However, taxonomic patterns may be consistent with multiple explanations, such as habitat filtering or biogeographical processes, which can also act differently across spatial scales. Here, we assessed multiple facets of diversity to determine the relative contributions of local versus regional processes and historical versus contemporary factors in establishing macroecological patterns. Location - From the Mediterranean peninsulas to northern Scandinavia. Time period - Species occurrence data gathered since c. 1980. Major organism group studied - Trichoptera (Insecta). Methods - Based on an extensive functional space and a phylogenetic tree including 197 and 509 species, respectively, and the composition of 180 communities, we assessed the distribution of taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity within 18 ecoregions (local α- and β-diversity) and among those ecoregions (regional γ- and β-diversity). Results - Local estimates of taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic α- and β-diversity were similar across Europe, which reveals that all streams have similar carrying capacity even though the local abiotic factors involved are likely different among ecoregions. In contrast, regional taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities decreased as latitude increased, whereas functional richness and functional dispersion displayed unimodal relationships. The position of species on the functional space was not conserved, while northern species pools were found to be phylogenetically clustered and southern ones overdispersed. The nestedness component mainly contributed to the taxonomic and phylogenetic β-diversity among northern communities, whereas in southern latitudes the turnover was dominant. Main conclusions - Decoupled latitudinal patterns of taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity reveal the importance of regional environmental filtering over local factors in limiting species range and shaping the regional species pool. The biogeographical signature is still present; the northern recolonizations following the Pleistocene glaciations originated exclusively from central regions, instead of Mediterranean refugia, as was previously accepted.","tags":[],"title":"Incongruent latitudinal patterns of taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity reveal different drivers of caddisfly community assembly across spatial scales","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

However, the significant enabling and inhibiting influence of AI for sustainable development needs to be assessed carefully, given that the technology diffuses rapidly and affects millions of people worldwide on a day-to-day basis. To address this challenge, a panel discussion was organized by the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, the AI Sustainability Center and MIT Massachusetts Institute of Technology, gathering a wide range of AI experts. This paper summarizes the insights from the panel discussion around the following themes; The role of AI in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); AI for a prosperous 21st century; Transparency, automated decision-making processes, and personal profiling; and Measuring the relevance of Digitalization and Artificial Intelligence (D\u0026AI) at the indicator level of SDGs. The research-backed panel discussion was dedicated to recognize and prioritize the agenda for addressing the pressing research gaps for academic research, funding bodies, professionals, as well as industry with an emphasis on the transportation sector. A common conclusion across these themes was the need to go beyond the development of AI in sectorial silos, so as to understand the impacts AI might have across societal, environmental, and economic outcomes.

Freshwater conservationists and environmental managers have enough evidence to demonstrate that action must not be delayed but have insufficient evidence to identify those actions that will be most effective in reversing the current trend. Here, the focus is on identifying essential research topics that, if addressed, will contribute directly to restoring freshwater biodiversity through supporting ‘bending the curve’ actions (i.e. those actions leading to the recovery of freshwater biodiversity, not simply deceleration of the current downward trend). The global freshwater research and management community was asked to identify unanswered research questions that could address knowledge gaps and barriers associated with ‘bending the curve’ actions. The resulting list was refined into six themes and 25 questions. Although context-dependent and potentially limited in global reach, six overarching themes were identified; (i) learning from successes and failures; (ii) improving current practices; (iii) balancing resource needs; (iv) rethinking built environments; (v) reforming policy and investments; and (vi) enabling transformative change. Bold, efficient, science-based actions are necessary to reverse biodiversity loss. We believe that conservation actions will be most effective when supported by sound evidence, and that research and action must complement one another. These questions are intended to guide global freshwater researchers and conservation practitioners, identify key projects and signal research needs to funders and governments. Our questions can act as springboards for multidisciplinary and multisectoral collaborations that will improve the management and restoration of freshwater biodiversity.","tags":[],"title":"Twenty-five essential research questions to inform the protection and restoration of freshwater biodiversity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

In recent years, molecular survey methods detecting DNA released by target-species into their environment (eDNA) have been rapidly on the rise. Despite providing new, cost-effective tools for conservation, eDNA-based methods are prone to the occurrence of errors. Best field and laboratory practices can mitigate some, but risks of errors cannot be eliminated and need to be accounted for. Here, we synthesise recent advances in data processing tools that increase the reliability of interpretations drawn from eDNA data. We review advances in occupancy models to consider spatial data-structures and simultaneously assess rates of false positive and negative results. Further, we introduce process-based models and the integration of metabarcoding data as complementing approaches to increase reliability of target-species assessments. These tools will be most effective when capitalising on multi-source datasets collating eDNA with classical survey and citizen-science approaches, paving the way for more robust decision-making processes in conservation planning.","tags":[],"title":"Improving the reliability of eDNA data interpretation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.J.

Alpha taxonomy historically relied on expert knowledge to describe new species using phenotypic and biogeographic evidence, which has the appearance of investigator subjectivity. In contrast, DNA-based methods using the multispecies coalescent model (MSC) promise a more objective approach to describing biodiversity. However, recent criticisms of the MSC suggest that under some conditions, molecular delimitation may over-split lineages and identify species that do not reflect biological reality. Here, we reconcile these two approaches using empirical data for the Greenthroat Darter complex (Etheostoma lepidum), a small freshwater fish species with a disjunct distribution in Texas and New Mexico, USA. We demonstrate that MSC species delimitation recognizes all nine sampled populations as distinct species, sometimes splitting specimens from a single locality into multiple species. However, environmental, phenotypic, and biogeographic evidence do not fully corroborate the nine species supported by the MSC. Instead, the collective evidence indicates that E. lepidum fits a delimitation model comprised of three species that are consistent with the molecular phylogeny; Etheostoma lepidum (Greenthroat Darter) in rivers draining the eastern Edwards Plateau, Etheostoma cf. lepidum (Texas Darter) in the Concho and San Saba River systems, and Etheostoma cf. lepidum (Pecos Darter) in the Pecos River. One newly delimited species, E. cf. lepidum Pecos Darter, is likely highly imperiled due to its localized distribution in the Pecos River and reliance on vanishing spring-fed stream habitats. The impending biodiversity crisis makes integrative and swift species delimitation more necessary than ever. Our study exemplifies how classic taxonomic expertise combined with molecular phylogenetics can produce a more robust description of threatened biodiversity.","tags":[],"title":"Integrative species delimitation: testing the efficacy of the multispecies coalescent model in the Greenthroat Darter complex (Percidae: Etheostomatinae)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.B. van Rees,","K.A.

Future policies and strategies must have a greater focus on the unique ecology of freshwater life and its multiple threats, and now is a critical time to reflect on how this may be achieved. We identify priority topics including environmental flows, water quality, invasive species, integrated water resources management, strategic conservation planning, and emerging technologies for freshwater ecosystem monitoring. We synthesize these topics with decades of first‐hand experience and recent literature into 14 special recommendations for global freshwater biodiversity conservation based on the successes and setbacks of European policy, management, and research. Applying and following these recommendations will inform and enhance the ability of global and European post‐2020 biodiversity agreements to halt and reverse the rapid global decline of freshwater biodiversity.","tags":[],"title":"Safeguarding freshwater life beyond 2020: Recommendations for the new global biodiversity framework from the European experience","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.C.

The authors suggested that water quality has been improving, thereby challenging recent reports documenting drastic global declines in freshwater biodiversity. We raise two major concerns with the meta‐analysis and suggest that these account for the discrepancy with the declines reported elsewhere. First, total abundance and biomass alone are poor indicators of the status of freshwater insect assemblages, and the observed differences may well have been driven by the replacement of sensitive species with tolerant ones. Second, many of the datasets poorly represent global trends and reflect responses to local conditions or nonrandom site selection. We conclude that the results of the meta‐analysis should not be considered indicative of an overall improvement in the condition of freshwater ecosystems.","tags":[],"title":"Revisiting global trends in freshwater insect biodiversity","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Here are some useful commands to move point records to a stream network and to extract the values for each point.

We used all 16 global circulation models (GCMs) and regional climate models (RCMs) of the CORDEX dataset under the RCP 8.5 scenario to calculate future river flows. The high variability in relative change of flow among the 16 climate models cascaded into the ecological models and resulted in substantially different predicted abundance values for single species.

For SDMs in river ecosystems, species occurrences and predictor data are often aggregated across subcatchments that serve as modeling units. The level of aggregation (i.e., model resolution) influences the statistical relationships between species occurrences and environmental predictors—a phenomenon known as the modifiable area unit problem (MAUP), making model outputs directly contingent on the model resolution. Here, we test how model performance, predictor importance, and the spatial congruence of species predictions depend on the model resolution (i.e., average subcatchment size) of SDMs. We modeled the potential habitat suitability of 50 native fish species in the upper Danube catchment at 10 different model resolutions. Model resolutions were derived using a 90-m digital-elevation model by using the GRASS-GIS module r.watershed. Here, we decreased the average subcatchment size gradually from 632 to 2 km2. We then ran ensemble SDMs based on five algorithms using topographical, climatic, hydrological, and land-use predictors for each species and resolution. Model evaluation scores were consistently high, as sensitivity and True Skill Statistic values ranged from 86.1–93.2 and 0.61–0.73, respectively. The most contributing predictor changed from topography at coarse, to hydrology at fine resolutions. Climate predictors played an intermediate role for all resolutions, while land use was of little importance. Regarding the predicted habitat suitability, we identified a spatial filtering from coarse to intermediate resolutions. The predicted habitat suitability within a coarse resolution was not ported to all smaller, nested subcatchments, but only to a fraction that held the suitable environmental conditions. Across finer resolutions, the mapped predictions were spatially congruent without such filter effect. We show that freshwater SDM predictions can have consistently high evaluation scores while mapped predictions differ significantly and are highly contingent on the underlying subcatchment size. We encourage building freshwater SDMs across multiple catchment sizes, to assess model variability and uncertainties in model outcomes emerging from the MAUP.","tags":[],"title":"From topography to hydrology - the modifiable area unit problem impacts freshwater species distribution models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F.

Stream diatoms and macroinvertebrates form an essential component of freshwater ecosystems in high-mountain regions. Although these organisms are sensitive to environmental changes, knowledge regarding their elevational diversity patterns remains limited. Opposite aspects (e.g., north vs south; west vs east) usually receive different amounts of solar radiation and precipitation, leading to distinct in-stream characteristics such as discharge, flow regime, and water temperature. Despite the suggested strong influence of aspect on biodiversity patterns in mountains, its effect on stream diatoms and macroinvertebrates has been largely overlooked. The aims of our study were to 1) investigate whether macroinvertebrate and diatom taxon richness follows the same pattern along an elevational gradient; 2) test the effect of aspect on the elevational diversity (i.e., taxon richness and assemblage dissimilarity) patterns of macroinvertebrate and diatom assemblages; and 3) examine the relative importance of elevation, aspect, and the local environment (e.g., in-stream physicochemical variables) in shaping macroinvertebrate and diatom assemblages. We investigated macroinvertebrate and diatom assemblages in six nearly parallel streams (three streams on the east aspect and three on the west) in the Hengduan Mountains region. We found that the taxon richness of both macroinvertebrates and diatoms showed a monotonic increase with elevation (1623–2905 m a.s.l.) when aspect was not accounted for. When aspect was taken into consideration, macroinvertebrate taxon richness still showed a monotonically increasing elevational pattern on both the east and west aspects, but with significantly different model slopes, while a monotonical pattern for diatoms only remained on the west aspect. In addition, taxon richness of macroinvertebrates may also follow a potential unimodal pattern. The distance-decay relationships followed the same patterns as taxon richness, suggesting that the influence of aspect on diatom and macroinvertebrate assemblages was not negligible. Our results suggested that the diversity of both diatoms and macroinvertebrates was jointly determined by elevation, aspect and local environment. Compared to macroinvertebrates, the diatom assemblages were more strongly influenced by the local environment. To gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving elevational patterns of stream biodiversity in high-mountain regions, comparative studies that involve multiple organisms, streams, and mountains across a large elevational range are needed.","tags":[],"title":"Elevation, aspect, and local environment jointly determine diatom and macroinvertebrate diversity in the Hengduan Mountains region","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.

We address mainly ecological modellers but also potential users of modeling results. Various modeling approaches can be used to predict the response of ecosystems to anthropogenic interventions, including mechanistic models, statistical models, and machine learning approaches. Regardless of the chosen approach, we outline how to better align the modeling to the decision making process, and identify six requirements that we believe are important to increase the usefulness of ecological models for management support, especially if management decisions need to be justified to the public. These cover (i) a mechanistic understanding regarding causality, (ii) alignment of model input and output with the management decision, (iii) appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions, (iv) uncertainty quantification, (v) sufficient predictive performance, and (vi) transparent communication.

Despite the implementation of various environmental regulations, the challenges of safeguarding freshwater assets have so far not been tackled successfully. A promising way forward to stop the loss of freshwater biodiversity and to sustain freshwater‐based ESs is by implementing ecosystem‐based management (EBM), an environmental planning and adaptive management approach that jointly considers social and ecological needs. Responsible for considerable recent success in sustainably managing and conserving marine ecosystems, EBM has not yet been championed for fresh waters. A major reason for the delayed uptake of EBM in fresh waters is likely to be its complexity, requiring planners to be familiar with the latest developments in a range of different research areas. EBM would therefore benefit from becoming more tangible to receive attention on the ground. To facilitate uptake, eight core research areas for EBM and their innovations are introduced, and the way in which they feed into the workflow that guides the EBM planning stage is explained. The workflow links biodiversity distributions with ES supply‐and‐demand modelling and SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and timely) target planning, including scenario‐ and cross‐realm perspectives, the prioritization of management alternatives, spatial prioritization of biodiversity conservation and ES areas, and the quantification of uncertainties. Given the extensive resources, time, and technical capacity required to implement the full workflow, a light and an ultralight version of the workflow are also provided. Applied in concert, the eight well‐known research areas allow for better planning and operationalizing, and eventually for implementing EBM in freshwater ecosystems. EBM has great potential to increase public acceptance by introducing the consideration of human needs and aspirations into typically biodiversity‐driven conservation and management approaches. This will ultimately improve the integrity of freshwater ecosystems.","tags":[],"title":"Combining eight research areas to foster the uptake of ecosystem-based management in fresh waters","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

Existing GBI designs lacked a systematic method to allocate restoration zones. This study proposes a novel approach for systematically selecting cost-effective areas for restoration on the basis of biodiversity, ecosystem services, and ecosystem condition to give an optimal spatial design of GBI. The approach was tested at a regional scale, in a transboundary setting encompassing the Intercontinental Biosphere Reserve of the Mediterranean in Andalusia (Spain) – Morocco (IBRM), across three aquatic ecosystems - freshwater, coastal and marine. We applied Marxan with Zones to stakeholder-defined scenarios of GBI in the IBRM. Specifically, we aimed to identify management zones within the GBl that addressed different conservation, restoration and exploitation objectives. Although almost all conservation targets were achieved, our results highlighted that the proportion of conservation features (i.e., biodiversity, ecosystem services) that would be compromised in the GBl, and the proportion of provisioning services that would be lost due to conservation (i.e., incidental representation) are potentially large, indicating that the probability of conflicts between conservation and exploitation goals in the area is high. The implementation of restoration zones improved connectivity across the GBI, and also achieved European and global policy targets. Our approach may help guide future applications of GBI to implement the flexible conservation management that aquatic environments require, considering many areas at different spatial scales, across multiple ecosystems, and in transboundary contexts.","tags":[],"title":"Cost-effective restoration and conservation planning in Green and Blue Infrastructure designs.

Here, we provide a comparative evaluation of how accounting for spatial dependencies, that is, autocorrelation, affects the delineation of optimized protected areas. - Location - Southeast Australia, Southeast U.S. Continental Shelf, Danube River Basin.  - Methods - We employ Bayesian spatially explicit and non‐spatial SDMs for terrestrial, marine and freshwater species, using realm‐specific planning unit shapes (grid, hexagon and subcatchment, respectively). We then apply the software gurobi to optimize conservation plans based on species targets derived from spatial and non‐spatial SDMs (10%–50% each to analyse sensitivity), and compare the delineation of the plans.  - Results - Across realms and irrespective of the planning unit shape, spatially explicit SDMs (a) produce on average more accurate predictions in terms of AUC, TSS, sensitivity and specificity, along with a higher species detection probability. All spatial optimizations meet the species conservation targets. Spatial conservation plans that use predictions from spatially explicit SDMs (b) are spatially substantially different compared to those that use non‐spatial SDM predictions, but (c) encompass a similar amount of planning units. The overlap in the selection of planning units is smallest for conservation plans based on the lowest targets and vice versa. - Main conclusions - Species distribution models are core tools in conservation planning. Not surprisingly, accounting for the spatial characteristics in SDMs has drastic impacts on the delineation of optimized conservation plans. We therefore encourage practitioners to consider spatial dependencies in conservation features to improve the spatial representation of future protected areas.","tags":[],"title":"Spatially explicit species distribution models: A missed opportunity in conservation planning?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Recently, ecologists and biogeographers have recognized the need of analysing ecological communities in the light of multiple facets including not only species‐level information but also functional and phylogenetic approaches to improve our understanding of the relative contribution of processes shaping biodiversity. Here, our aim was to disentangle the relative importance of environmental variables measured at multiple levels (i.e., local, catchment, climate, and spatial variables) influencing variation in macroinvertebrate beta diversity facets (i.e., species, traits, and phylogeny) and their components (i.e., replacement and abundance difference) in boreal streams. - Taxon - Aquatic macroinvertebrates - Location - Western Finland - Methods - A total of 105 streams were sampled in western Finland, encompassing a geographical extent over 500 km. We analysed variation in the different beta diversity facets and components using distance‐based redundancy analysis and associated variation partitioning procedures. We modelled spatial structures using distance‐based Moran eigenvector maps. - Results - We found that the relative influence of explanatory variables on each diversity facet and component revealed relatively similar patterns. Our main finding was that local environmental and spatial variables generally contributed most to the total explained variability in all facets and components of beta diversity, whereas catchment and climate variables explained less variation in the beta diversity facets at the spatial scale considered in this study. - Main conclusions - Different facets of beta diversity were mainly influenced by local environmental variables and spatial structuring, likely acting through deterministic and stochastic pathways respectively. Identifying the ecological variables and mechanisms that drive variation in beta diversity may be used to guide the conservation and restoration efforts for biodiversity under global change.","tags":[],"title":"Local environment and space drive multiple facets of stream macroinvertebrate beta diversity","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Effective date: August 02, 2019\nThis site provides information regarding the Privacy Policy and Legal Notes in compliance with § 6 TDG (“Telemediengesetz”).\nThe Research Group “Global Freshwater Biodiversity, Biogeography \u0026amp; Conservation”, also named “us”, “we”, or “our” in this Privacy Policy, operates the https://glowabio.org website.\nWe want to inform you of our policies regarding the use of personal data when you visit our website and the choices you have associated with that data.

Ecosystem-based management (EBM) has been proposed as an approach that could more efficiently and adaptively balance ecological and societal needs. However, this raises the question of how social and ecological objectives can be included in an integrated management plan. Here, we present a generic model-coupling framework tailored to address this question for freshwater ecosystems, using three components - biodiversity, ecosystem services (ESS), and a spatial prioritisation that aims to balance the spatial representation of biodiversity and ESS supply and demand. We illustrate this model-coupling approach within the Danube River Basin using the spatially explicit, potential distribution of (i) 85 fish species as a surrogate for biodiversity as modelled using hierarchical Bayesian models, and (ii) four estimated ESS layers produced by the Artificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services (ARIES) platform (with ESS supply defined as carbon storage and flood regulation, and demand specified as recreation and water use). These are then used for (iii) a joint spatial prioritisation of biodiversity and ESS employing Marxan with Zones, laying out the spatial representation of multiple management zones. Given the transboundary setting of the Danube River Basin, we also run comparative analyses including the country-level purchasing power parity (PPP)-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) and each country's percent cover of the total basin area as potential cost factors, illustrating a scheme for balancing the share of establishing specific zones among countries. We demonstrate how emphasizing various biodiversity or ESS targets in an EBM model-coupling framework can be used to cost-effectively test various spatially explicit management options across a multi-national case study. We further discuss possible limitations, future developments, and requirements for effectively managing a balance between biodiversity and ESS supply and demand in freshwater ecosystems.","tags":[],"title":"Social equity shapes zone-selection: Balancing aquatic biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services delivery in the transboundary Danube River Basin","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.E.

Climate and topography have been shown to explain species' distributions at continental scales, but the contribution of natural and anthropogenically altered streamflow is often omitted in large‐scale analyses due to the lack of appropriate data. We test how macroinvertebrate occurrences can be linked to streamflow observations and evaluate the relative importance of streamflow regimes and water use for macroinvertebrate occurrences from 19 orders across Europe. We first paired species sampling locations with hydrological gauging stations considering 5 combinations of the geographic distance and difference in flow accumulation (upstream contributing area). We then used Generalized Linear Models to assess the influence of the streamflow regime, simulated water use, and climate and topography on the occurrence of macroinvertebrates. The pairing method that assigned species records to the closest gauging station in terms of both distance and flow accumulation performed best. Most of the species studied occurred preferentially in river habitats with low mean annual streamflow and streamflow variability, high winter streamflow, and low levels of water withdrawals for irrigation or manufacturing. We conclude that flow accumulation is a useful proxy to evaluate the proximity of species records to gauging stations, omitting species records that do not belong to a given stream reach. The strong contribution of streamflow and water use indicators on macroinvertebrate occurrences underline their importance for yielding robust occurrence estimates.","tags":[],"title":"Using streamflow observations to estimate the impact of hydrological regimes and anthropogenic water use on European stream macroinvertebrate occurrences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.E.

We used a unique collection of over 1,000 local population time series in 22 communities across terrestrial, freshwater and marine realms within central Europe to compare the impacts of long-term temperature change and other environmental drivers from 1980 onwards. To disentangle different drivers, we related species’ population trends to species- and driver-specific attributes, such as temperature and habitat preference or pollution tolerance. We found a consistent impact of temperature change on the local abundances of terrestrial species. Populations of warm-dwelling species increased more than those of cold-dwelling species. In contrast, impacts of temperature change on aquatic species’ abundances were variable. Effects of temperature preference were more consistent in terrestrial communities than effects of habitat preference, suggesting that the impacts of temperature change have become widespread for recent changes in abundance within many terrestrial communities of central Europe.","tags":[],"title":"Cross-realm assessment of climate change impacts on species’ abundance trends","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.C.

Here, we propose a simple technique to approximate changes in invertebrate and fish biomonitoring results. Taxa lists for 60 (invertebrate) and 52 (fish) sites were each modified by 10 multipliers as stepwise 5% or 10% changes in abundances to simulate potential climate-change severity, reflecting increasing climate change effects. These 10 multipliers were based on the stream zonation preference for invertebrates and the Fish Region Index (FRI) values for fish, both reflecting the longitudinal gradient present in river ecosystems. The original and modified taxa lists were analyzed using the standard assessment software for the particular group, followed by analysis of key biomonitoring metrics. For invertebrates, our simulations affected small good quality streams more often negatively while large poor mountain streams showed a tendency to improve. Forty percent of the invertebrate data sites showed a change in the final ecological assessment class when using the multipliers, with the poor quality sites changing more often.

The results are discussed as an example that facilitates the interpretation of potential climate-change effects with varying severity. Further, we discuss the simplified approach and implications for assessment from climate change induced range shifts.","tags":[],"title":"Severity Multipliers as a Methodology to Explore Potential Effects of Climate Change on Stream Bioassessment Programs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

To date, however, such quantitative information about freshwater species distributions remains limited. Major impediments include heterogeneity in available species occurrence data, varying detectability of species in their aquatic environment, scarcity of contiguous freshwater‐specific predictors, and methods that support addressing these issues in a single framework. Here we demonstrate the use of a hierarchical Bayesian modeling (HBM) framework that combines disparate species occurrence information with newly‐developed 1 km freshwater‐specific predictors, to account for imperfect species detection and make fine‐grain (1 km) estimates of distributions in freshwater organisms. The approach integrates a Bernoulli suitability and a Binomial observability process into a hierarchical zero‐inflated Binomial model. The suitability process includes point presence observations, records of site visits, 1 km environmental predictors and expert‐derived species range maps integrated with a distance‐decay function along the within‐stream distance as covariates. The observability process uses repeated observations to estimate a probability of observation given that the species was present. The HBM accounts for the spatial autocorrelation in species habitat suitability projections using an intrinsic Gaussian conditional autoregressive model. We used this framework for three fish species native to different regions and habitats in North America. Model comparison shows that HBMs significantly outperformed non‐spatial GLMs in terms of AUC and TSS scores, and that expert information when appropriately included in the model can provide an important refinement. Such ancillary species information and an integrative, hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework can therefore be used to advance fine‐grain habitat suitability predictions and range size estimates in the freshwater realm. Our approach is extendable in terms of data availability and generality and can be used on other freshwater organisms and regions.","tags":[],"title":"Model-based integration of observed and expert-based information for assessing the geographic and environmental distribution of freshwater species","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

However, macroecological studies of climate-change effects on aquatic biodiversity are rare because of a lack of standardized large-scale surveys, e.g., along large latitudinal gradients. Our goal was to assess the overall richness pattern and projected differences in present and future patterns of the stream insect orders Ephemeroptera (E), Plecoptera (P), Trichoptera (T), and combined EPT along an extensive latitudinal gradient across North America (30 to 70°N). We applied Bioclimatic Envelope Models (BEMs) to project present-day and future climatically suitable areas for EPTs on a spatial resolution of 10 arc-min (20 km × 20 km) across North America. To overcome issues related to spatially biased sampling, we assessed climatically suitable areas (CSAs) for each genus and modeled potential generic richness/grid cell, rather than assessing observed generic richness patterns directly. Projected present-day generic richness was greatest between 40 and 48°N latitude, with peaks at 44, 45, and 47°N for the E, P, and T orders, respectively. Our models projected that CSAs would shift an average 4.2 to 5.2°, 4.4 to 5.3° and 3.4 to 4.1°N latitude by 2080 for E, P, and T genera, respectively. Overall, the present-day projected generic EPT richness is highest in the warm and cool temperate zones and shows a unimodal richness pattern that is projected to shift northward under climate-change conditions. A similar northward shift of richness patterns might also apply to other aquatic insects with relatively narrow thermal sensitivity and terrestrial, winged adults, e.g., freshwater Diptera or many aquatic Coleoptera. This large-scale application of genus-by-genus models gives a first approximation of the likely consequences of climate-change effects on freshwater biota across North America.","tags":[],"title":"Current and future latitudinal gradients in stream macroinvertebrates richness across North America","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

This necessitates revisiting site prioritization and species protection for conservation. Patterns of richness and threat of four well-studied aquatic taxa, the fishes, crabs, molluscs and dragonflies largely coincide at the continental scale, at least in Africa. For this study, we focus on dragonflies, for which there is a point locality database, as a surrogate taxon, modeling the species at the fine-scale, using species distribution modeling. With this approach, we built a protected areas network using spatial planning software. Priority areas for dragonfly conservation largely coincided with analyses of global biodiversity hotspots. The Zambian swamps and woodlands, as well as the rainforests of the Lower Guinea and Congo Basin are emphasized as hotspots of dragonfly diversity. Among globally threatened species, 72% were recorded at least once in a protected area. Although the current reserve network covers 10.7% of the landscape, the proportional representation of species geographic distributions in reserves is only 1.2%. The reserve network is therefore inefficient concerning freshwater species, and many areas of conservation priority that are not formally protected remain. The advantage of operating at the fine scale, while covering a large geographic area is that it shifts the focus from the large-scale hotspots to smaller priority areas within and beyond hotspots. Also, by operating at the fine-scale for a large geographical area, the potential exists for local conservation managers to consider campaigning for the inclusion of the priority areas that are not formally protected, while adjacent to the existing reserve networks. Where this is not possible, we recommend monitoring these areas to detect future threats to the habitats that these might face.","tags":[],"title":"Continental-scale conservation prioritization of African dragonflies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

Using an ensemble of bioclimatic envelope models (BEMs), we modelled the climatic suitability of 191 stream macroinvertebrate species from 12 orders across Europe under two climate change scenarios for 2080 on a spatial resolution of 5 arc minutes. Analyses included assessments of relative changes in species’ climatically suitable areas as well as their potential shifts in latitude and longitude with respect to species’ thermal preferences. Climate‐change effects were also analysed regarding species’ ecological and biological groupings, namely (1) endemicity and (2) rarity within European ecoregions, (3) life cycle, (4) stream zonation preference and (5) current preference. The BEMs projected that suitable climate conditions would persist in Europe in the year 2080 for nearly 99% of the modelled species regardless of the climate scenario. Nevertheless, a decrease in the amount of climatically suitable areas was projected for 57–59% of the species. Depending on the scenario, losses could be of 38–44% on average. The suitable areas for species were projected to shift, on average, 4.7–6.6° north and 3.9–5.4° east. Cold‐adapted species were projected to lose climatically suitable areas, while gains were expected for warm‐adapted species. When projections were analysed for different species groupings, only endemics stood out as a particular group. That is, endemics were projected to lose significantly larger amounts of suitable climatic areas than nonendemic species.

Applying species distribution models (SDMs) in these ecosystems requires special attention because rivers are linear systems and their abiotic and biotic conditions are structured in a linear fashion with significant influences from upstream/downstream or lateral influences from adjacent areas. Our aim was to develop a modelling framework for benthic invertebrates in riverine ecosystems and to test our approach in a data‐rich study catchment. We present a case study of a 9‐km section of the lowland Kielstau River located in northern Germany. We linked hydrological, hydraulic and species distribution models to predict the habitat suitability for the bivalve Sphaerium corneum in a riverine system. The results generated by the hydrological model served as inputs into the hydraulic model, which was used to simulate the resulting water levels, velocities and sediment discharge within the stream channel. The ensemble model obtained good evaluation scores (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.96; kappa 0.86; true skill statistic 0.95; sensitivity 86.14; specificity 85.75). Mean values for variables at the sampling sites were not significantly different from the values at the predicted distribution (Mann–Whitney U‐test P \u003e 0.05). High occurrence probabilities were predicted in the downstream half of the 9‐km section of the Kielstau. The most important variable for the model was sediment discharge (contributing 40%), followed by water depth (30%), flow velocity (19%) and stream power (11%). The hydrological and hydraulic models are able to produce predictors, acting at different spatial scales, which are known to influence riverine organisms; which, in turn, are used by the SDMs as input. Our case study yielded good results, which corresponded well with ecological knowledge about our study organism. Although this method is feasible for making projections of habitat suitability on a local scale (a reach in a small catchment), we discuss remaining challenges for future modelling approaches and large‐scale applications.","tags":[],"title":"Modelling of riverine ecosystems by integrating models: conceptual approach, a case study and research agenda","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Anticipated increases in temperature and changes in hydrological regimes will have significant adverse impacts on the habitat suitability for many species. This threat will even be higher to endemic and already threatened species due to their restricted distribution and narrow climate tolerance ranges. We investigated the range shifts of a relict Himalayan dragonfly (Epiophlebia laidlawi), a species that is endemic to the Hindu Kush Himalayan region. Currently, the species is only known from few localities in Bhutan, India and Nepal. For conservation of the species, it is necessary to foresee potential suitable habitat areas and range shifts due to global climate change. Here, we first estimated the current potential geographic distribution by identifying the suitable habitat area in the region using bioclimatic envelope models, by means of consensus projections of six algorithms as implemented in the BIOMOD-package in the software program R. We then used the current distribution to render future projections under the A2a and B2a IPCC emission scenarios for the years 2050 and 2080. Models predict that the suitable habitat area of the species will shift on average 374 m and 599 m uphill under the extreme (A2a) climate warming scenario, and 294 m and 342 m uphill under the moderate (B2a) scenario by 2050 and 2080, respectively.

However, the effects of climate change at the most fundamental level of biodiversity—intraspecific genetic diversity—remain elusive4. Here we show that the use of morphospecies-based assessments of GCC effects will result in underestimations of the true scale of biodiversity loss. Species distribution modelling and assessments of mitochondrial DNA variability in nine montane aquatic insect species in Europe indicate that future range contractions will be accompanied by severe losses of cryptic evolutionary lineages and genetic diversity within these lineages.

Studies on the potential effects of GCC on low mountain areas remain sparse, however, despite the high conservation value of these areas as biodiversity refugia. We chose a species distribution modeling approach to assess potential GCC impacts on the future distributions of montane freshwater invertebrates under two different greenhouse gas scenarios and three averaged general circulation models. For this, ensemble models consisting of six algorithms [generalized linear model (GLM), generalized boosted model (GBM), generalized additive model (GAM), classification tree analysis (CTA), artificial neural networks (ANN), and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS)] were applied to project areas of 23 cold-stenothermic aquatic insects from montane regions of Central Europe. We found an average loss of 70–80% of the potential distribution for the study species until 2080, depending on the underlying Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenario. Species distribution ranges below 1000 m above sea level were found to decrease by up to ~96% according to the severest greenhouse gas emission scenario. While the Alps remain the single main refugium under the A2a greenhouse gas emission scenario, the more moderate climate scenario B2a shows fragmented potential persistence of montane insects in some low mountain ranges. The results show that montane freshwater assemblages in low mountain ranges are particularly threatened by ongoing GCC. As vertical dispersal is limited by elevational restriction, low mountain ranges may act as summit traps under GCC. We thus propose that GCC will lead to the extinction of several species and unique genetic lineages of postglacial relict species, resulting in a significant decline in Central European fauna.","tags":[],"title":"Low mountain ranges: summit traps for montane freshwater species under climate change","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

We modelled impacts of climate change on the distribution ranges of 38 species of benthic stream macroinvertebrates from nine macroinvertebrate orders covering all river zones from the headwaters to large river reaches. Species altitudinal shifts as well as range changes up to the year 2080 were simulated using the A2a and B2a Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change climate‐warming scenarios. Presence‐only species distribution models were constructed for a stream network in Germany’s lower mountain ranges by means of consensus projections of four algorithms, as implemented in the BIOMOD package in R (GLM, GAM, GBM and ANN). Species were predicted to shift an average of 122 and 83 m up in altitude along the river continuum by the year 2080 under the A2a and B2a climate‐warming scenarios, respectively. No correlation between altitudinal shifts and mean annual air temperature of species’ occurrence could be detected. Depending on the climate‐warming scenario, most or all (97% for A2a and 100% for B2a) of the macroinvertebrate species investigated were predicted to survive under climate change in the study area. Ranges were predicted to contract for species that currently occur in streams with low annual mean air temperatures but expand for species that inhabit rivers where air temperatures are higher. Our models predict that novel climate conditions will reorganise species composition and community structure along the river continuum. Possible effects are discussed, including significant reductions in population size of headwater species, eventually leading to a loss of genetic diversity. A shift in river species composition is likely to enhance the establishment of non‐native macroinvertebrates in the lower reaches of the river continuum.","tags":[],"title":"Climate-change winners and losers: stream macroinvertebrates of a submontane region in Central Europe","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://glowabio.org/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
